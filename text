st.markdown("**Carbon Dioxide (CO2)**: It is the most common greenhouse gas. Human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas) and deforestation increase CO2 emissions.")
st.markdown("**CH4**: It is a stronger greenhouse gas compared to carbon dioxide. It is released into the atmosphere through natural gas production, agricultural activities (especially livestock farming), and the decomposition of organic waste in landfills.")
st.markdown("### **How Are Greenhouse Gases Produced?**\n\n" 
         "1. **Burning of Fossil Fuels**: The consumption of fuel in vehicles and the use of coal for electricity generation result in carbon dioxide emissions.\n" 
         "2. **Agricultural Activities**: Livestock farming produces methane gas, while the use of fertilizers leads to nitrous oxide emissions.\n" 
         "3. **Industrial Production**: Carbon dioxide and fluorinated gases are released during chemical processes and the production of certain products.\n" 
         "4. **Waste**: The decomposition of organic waste in landfills produces methane gas.\n"
         "**alt**: Greenhouse gases can also come from natural sources such as volcanic eruptions and the respiration of animals.\n"
         "**alt**: Additionally, the burning of biomass and wildfires can release significant amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.")
